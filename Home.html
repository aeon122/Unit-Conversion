        <h3>Unit Conversion</h3>

        <p>Conversion of Units is a multi-step process that converts units of measurement for the same quantity. It includes division or multiplication by a numerical factor or rounding off the significant digits. These are important because the units are
            used in various places such as the commercial marketplace, technical documents, temperature, and for other specifications. A common conversion table states the length, volume, mass, and area. The units are expressed by using scientific notation
            and converted into numerical values as per the quantities.</p>

        <p>Conversion of Units is done according to the international standard of measurements. The pre-defined unit conversion tables and algorithms are available that make the conversion easy and convenient. Some common examples are: Converting Celsius
            to Fahrenheit Converting ounces to kilograms The prime purpose of conversion relies on the specific situation. Some factors on which it may depend on are: The number of significant figures. The intended use of numbers which are used for measurement
            in engineering tolerances. It is subdivided into two parts, i.e., soft conversion and hard conversion. The soft conversion needs to precise whereas hard conversion may not be exactly equivalent.</p>
