            <h3>Mile/hour</h3>
            <p><b>Definition:</b> The unit miles per hour (symbol: mph) is a measurement of speed in the imperial and United States customary systems. It expresses the number of statute miles traveled over the period of one hour. One mph equals exactly 1.609344
                kilometers per hour (km/h). Along with km/h, mph is most typically used in relation to road traffic speeds. It is most widely used in the United States, the United Kingdom, and their related territories. It is also used in the Canadian
                rail system, though the Canadian road systems use km/h.</p>

            <p><b>Current use:</b> Along with km/h, mph is most typically used in relation to road traffic speeds. It is most widely used in the United States, the United Kingdom, and their related territories. It is also used in the Canadian rail system,
                though the Canadian road systems use km/h.</p>

            <h3>Kilometer/hour</h3>
            <p><b>Definition:</b> The unit kilometers per hour (symbol: km/h) is a unit of speed expressing the number of kilometers traveled in one hour. Km/h is currently the most commonly used unit of speed around the world and is typically used for car
                speeds and road signs. It is also common for both miles per hour as well as kilometers per hour to be displayed on car speedometers. There are many abbreviations for the unit kilometers per hour (kph, kmph, k.p.h, KMph., etc.), but "km/h"
                is the SI unit symbol.</p>
